# PassageGLV

Code for fitting a General Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model to long-term passging experiments.

Original Hardware Specifictions:
* OS: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro (v10.0.22631)
* Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16-Core Processor
* RAM: 128 GB

Expected Run Time for Model Fitting (9 Processes): 240-300 Minutes

Run time may need to be extended for model fitting as it is based on a time limit.

Cross validation may take up to a day (high throughput computing servers) or up to two weeks depending on setup.

It is expected that the model fitting process can take up to a week or more for computers with worse specifications.

Ideally, each trial run (distributed) should be run separately since the timers (each run is timed) may overlap, which may end prematurely. An easy solution is to rerun many times and filter the ones that failed.

## Installation Guide and Usage with included files

1. Download [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (v1.10.1)
    * Recommended: Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia) (VS Code) for running Julia for this for an interactive experience. Click the link to learn how to get started with Julia in VS Code.
    * Not Recommended: Open Windows terminal and type "julia \<filename\>".
    * Not Recommended: Open the Julia REPL in that directory and type include("\<filename\>") to run the .jl files.

2. Install the required packages using **install_packages.jl**
3. Run **fit_data_NL_opt_dist_passage_constr.jl** to get parameters. If needed, run **fit_LOOCV.jl** for the cross validation (may need to change some lines for different setups). **fit_pair_triple** only uses pairs or triples of species.
    * Change the number of processes "addprocs" according to your hardware
    * Parameters are stored in GLV_pars_passage_constr folder
4. Run **param_analysis_passage_contr.jl** to get parameter CSV file and associated plot or SVG file
5. Run **passage_constr_analysis.jl** to get the predictions CSV file. Similar for **LOOCV_analysis.jl** and **pair_triple_analysis.jl**.
6. Run **sample_simulations_passage_constr.jl** to see some simulations of the model

## Installation Guide and Usage with alternative files

1. Same as steps 1-2 with the original files
2. Format your csv in the same way as the original
3. Change get_data.jl for your data
4. Change the time-related variables in other files according to your experiments
5. Same as steps 4-6 with the original files (change as needed)
